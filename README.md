# Beware the C's are # here

Be carefully, there's a lot of C#'s around.

## It's silly, Billy

Believe it or not, I often have to interface / interact with C#/.NET libraries, frameworks or services. It helps to be able to speak
the lingo and even make changes where required. From time to time, I can also be accused of creating a .NET-based service or solution
from scratch...

## No, I do not want to work on your .NET or Xamarin project

Sorry, the .NET / C# / Xamarin work I do is for legacy clients and I'm not taking on new work on these platforms.

## CAUTION

These are _experiments_, so please don't just blindly run any of this code on your computer. Some if it could be meant to recreate a bug or some unexpected behaviour. I try to document that when I add something like that to a public repo, but, alas, something could slip through. Take care. Better yet, use someone else computer!
